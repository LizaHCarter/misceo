## Misceo

### Description
Misceo lets you use a crawler to experience the web differently. Give it a starting site and a depth, our crawler will download all images from the site and follow all links. It will repeat this until it reaches the specified depth.
You can view all these images, and view graphs about describing each of your crawls. Users can make a profile, including a picture taken from their webcam, and send messages to other users.
